# transiient

Hello!

I'm a sysadmin specialising in VMware, Windows, Linux, and Azure administration. I love to spend time automating repetitive or mundane tasks, and I'm a big supporter of sharing knowledge, so I thought it was about time I set up a blog to publish it.

I've recently emigrated to Australia from the UK, so a lot of what I write now will be things that I am working on at home, or have edited from my extensive library of documentation!

Check out my scripts [on GitHub](https://github.com/transiient) if you're interested.

## Open to Work

I'm open to work remotely across Australia (and beyond - I'm very flexible!) or for contract work in Townsville, QLD. [Contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sgcrossman) if you're hiring!
