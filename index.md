# transiient

Hello!

I'm a sysadmin specialising in VMware, Windows, Linux, and Azure administration. I love to spend time automating repetitive or mundane tasks, and I'm a big supporter of sharing knowledge, so I thought it was about time I set up a blog to publish it.

I am soon emigrating from the UK to Australia for a few years (maybe longer), so a lot of what I write here will be things that I am working on at home, or have pulled from my extensive library of notes and documentation!

Check out my scripts [on GitHub](https://github.com/transiient) if you're interested.
